# Breadth First Search implementation using Vanilla JS

I developed this demonstration out of pure curiosity. The Khan Academy algorithms course first section has a description of what the BFS algorithm does, so I decided to give it a try. 

# Try it

1. Have Node.js (preferably v22.17.0) installed;
2. Run the script `npm run start`;
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For anyone interested in the course, here's the address:
